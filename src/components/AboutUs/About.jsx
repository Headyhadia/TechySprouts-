        <p className={styles.aboutlines}>
          At TechySprouts, we believe every child carries the seed of
          brilliance. It only needs the right soil to grow. In a world powered
          by technology, coding has become the new language of success. While
          most kids are kept busy with screens that consume their time, we
          empower young minds to create with them.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.aboutlines}>
          Our journey began with a simple but powerful question:
        </p>
        <p className={styles.boldline}>
          ‚ÄúWhat if every child had the tools and confidence to shape the future
          instead of just following it?‚Äù
        </p>
        <p className={styles.aboutlines}>
          That question gave birth to TechySprouts ‚Äî an online coding academy
          where innovation takes root early.
